# tank-headless-cms

This project has reached MVP (Minimal Viable Product) status and is no longer being developed.

Technologies used:
Strapi CMS, GraphQL, Bootstrap, React and React Router

A React/Strapi Headless CMS mockup of a used Tank marketplace specializing in WW2 era vehicles with detailed statistics and historic descriptions on a catalog of tank variants for educational and entertainment purposes.

This project uses Strapi a content management service (CMS), but a more common one such as Wordpress could have also be used. Since the CMS communicates with the front end using a standard REST API we can pick those up (In this case using GraphQL) and build any kind of front end (React in this case) and have a fully custom UI with the ease of use of a CMS. This would be the perfect setup for a custom website that also needs its content to be updated regularly by non-technical users.


Screnshot of UI as of first commit after hooking up Front & Backend.

This is the code for the ratings generation. I thought it was pretty cool.

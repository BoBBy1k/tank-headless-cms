# tank-headless-cms

This is my current active project and is still very much WIP. I will be working on it or doing research for it daily until all main functionality is completed.

A React/Strapi Headless CMS mockup of a used Tank marketplace specializing in WW2 era vehicles with detailed statistics and historic descriptions on a catalog of tank variants for educational and entertainment purposes.

Screnshot of UI as of first commit after hooking up Front & Backend.
